# HANDOFF.md — session log

> Purpose: a fresh agent (or a human) picks up here when a session ends or runs out of context.
> **Newest first. Terse. English.** One entry per session: Did · Validation · Residual risks ·
> Blocked · Next. The **Resume point** is the single answer to "where do I start?" — keep it current.

## Resume point

**Phase 1 — COMPLETE.** **D-04 (public stand-in dataset) — COMPLETE** (13 records pinned, sha256
stable, PROJECT.md §8.6). **P2-01 — COMPLETE** (golden · 2nd genome · both diverged-IR genomes
exit 2, in `tests/golden/test_e2e.py`).

**Phase 2 status:** P2-01 · P2-02 · P2-03 · P2-04 · P2-05 · P2-06 · P2-11 **DONE**.
P2-07 · P2-08 **implemented and unit-verified, real-data run pending MAFFT 7.526** (absent here;
`apt` would install a different version and §7.8 pins 7.526 — no number was measured with the
wrong aligner). **P2-09 (Word gene table) and P2-10 (manuscript) are NOT started.**

**Next action: D2-04 + P2-09 (Word gene table).** Note the architectural point: a `.docx` is
binary, while `runner._write` currently takes `dict[str, str]`. The export layer needs to accept
bytes (seam 2: the export layer writes files, never a module), and the format should be requested
explicitly at the CLI rather than emitted implicitly. Dependency per D2-04: `python-docx` +
`openpyxl` as an **optional extra** so the minimum install stays pure Python.

Then **P2-10** — needs the team's real samples; the stand-in set (PROJECT.md §8.6) can produce a
clearly labelled draft.

**Before P2-07/08 numbers are used for anything:** the alignment must come from MAFFT 7.526, and
§6's golden Ts/Tv (2.686) has the narrower scope *CDS only · 76 shared genes · IR excluded* — the
module's default whole-alignment scope is a different number and must never be quoted as that one.

Open item deliberately left: for a record with **no annotation**, nothing cross-checks the de-novo IR
length — `PZ428230.1` passed the gate on a 15,756 bp repeat while every congener is ~25.7 kb
(PROJECT.md §9.A-8). A congener length check is *not built* — decide before P2-07/08 use the set.

**Waiting on people:** real Oldenlandia/Coleus samples → P2-10 only (stand-ins now unblock
P2-07/08/11 development) · real Illumina reads + nuclear genome → Phase 6/7 · item (c) → docs.

**Branches (all pushed to `origin`, 2026-10-03):** `main` = **Phase 1 complete** (fast-forwarded to
the Phase-1 tip, no merge commit) · `feat/phase-1` · `feat/p1-02-core-model` · `feat/p1-04-result-schema`
(the stacked Phase-1 branches, kept for reference; their commits are already in `main`) ·
**`feat/phase-2` = current**, four commits on top of `main` — a PR from it to `main` shows exactly
those four, which is why Phase 1 was fast-forwarded in first.

Every commit on `feat/phase-2` was checked out and `make check`-verified individually, so
`git bisect` is usable across the branch.

**Data note:** `.panel/` is gitignored; re-fetch the stand-in set with the two `panel pin --groups`
commands in PROJECT.md §8.6.

## Log

### 2026-10-03 · Claude · dev WSL · session 3 (P2-03 … P2-08, P2-11, D2-01/02/03)

- **Did:** completed seven Phase-2 tasks. `core/codon.py` + `modules/codon_usage.py` (RSCU · ENC ·
  CAI · CBI · Fop), `core/protein.py` + `modules/amino_acid.py` (GRAVY · aromaticity),
  `modules/introns.py`, SSR by region + motif, `modules/diversity.py` (π) and
  `modules/substitutions.py` (Ts/Tv), plus group labels on comparison output.
  D2-01 (multi-genome contract, `docs/API_v0.2.md`), D2-02 (π 600/200), D2-03 (NCBI table 1).
- **Validation:** `make check` green — **169 fast + 22 golden**. Every new number is either a
  §6 golden number or an analytic check (ENC = 61 unbiased / 20 at the extreme; CAI = Fop = CBI = 1
  for a self-referenced sequence; π of a known alignment; the two IR copies' skew mirrors exactly).
- **Six real bugs found by the new work, each now a regression test:**
  1. `_parse_gff` read only `monomeric_repeat` — MISA writes every longer unit as `microsatellite`
     and a compound as one `repeat_region` line, so **7 of 37 SSRs were silently dropped**. The old
     test fixture invented a type MISA never writes, which is why it passed. P2-06's reconciliation
     column caught it.
  2. `coding_sequence` — re-sorting a trans-spliced gene's parts or reading them all forward gives
     a wrong ORF; only per-part strand + annotation order yields rps12's `ATG…TAA`.
  3. Two independent copies of a `Table` key were allowed (`rpl2.1` twice) — references resolved
     silently to one row. `Table` now rejects a repeated key.
  4. `load_groups` let `yaml.YAMLError` through (not a `ValueError`) — a malformed file crashed
     with a traceback instead of a message.
  5. `NcbiClient.resolve` could leak a `KeyError` where `NcbiError` belongs.
  6. `entry_from_summary` claimed `annotated=True` for every record; GenBank submissions are not
     annotated by default — 3 of the 11 stand-in plastomes have zero gene features.
- **Residual risks:** the comparison modules are unit-verified but **no real-data number was
  measured** — MAFFT is absent and installing a different version than the pinned 7.526 would
  measure the wrong thing. π per intron/IGS is still missing from P2-08.
- **Blocked:** nothing. P2-10 still needs the team's real samples.
- **Next:** P2-09 (see the binary-export note in the resume point), then P2-10.

### 2026-10-03 · Claude · dev WSL · session 2 (stand-in data, P2-01, P2-02)

- **Did:** **D-04** — a public stand-in dataset for Oldenlandia/Coleus: `data/*.yaml` definitions
  (13 records), `panel pin --groups` (new) + `--index` now optional + live accession resolution via
  the new `NcbiClient.resolve`; `PinnedGenome` measures gene counts · topology · IR outcome at pin
  time, so `PINNED.json` *is* the verification table. Hardened what the first cut got wrong
  (all found by a review pass): malformed YAML raised a traceback (`yaml.YAMLError` is not a
  `ValueError`), `resolve` could leak a `KeyError`, `annotated=True` was assumed for GenBank
  records. **P2-01** done (e2e tests: golden numbers in report *and* CSV · 2nd golden genome ·
  both diverged-IR genomes exit 2). **P2-02** done — `modules/structure.py` + `gc_skew()` +
  `structure.en.md` + `tests/unit/test_structure.py`.
- **Validation:** `make check` green — **124 fast + 18 golden**. All 13 sha256 re-verified
  byte-identical on a second pin. Structure on the golden genome reproduces LSC 83,127 ·
  IRa = IRb = 26,214 · SSC 18,169 · tiling 153,724, and the two IR copies skew exactly opposite
  (reverse complements) — a real correctness signal for the sign convention.
- **Residual risks:** `PZ428230.1` is a bad record (15,756 bp IR, `linear`) — excluded from
  position-based analysis, and nothing in the tool would have caught it automatically (§9.A-8).
  The API doc said `table[rowkey].column` but the implementation parses `table.rowkey.column`;
  no template had used a row key until now — docs corrected to the tested syntax, code unchanged.
  3 of 11 stand-in plastomes have no annotation (0 CDS) — sequence-level analyses only.
- **Blocked:** nothing. P2-10 still needs the team's real samples.
- **Next:** P2-03 (decide D2-03 first), then P2-04 … P2-11.

### 2026-10-03 · Claude · dev WSL

- **Did:** finished Phase 1. P1-10 complete: `core/panel.py` (4 tiers, modes A/B, quality filter,
  `pin()` with an injected fetcher that re-reads the file with our own reader) · `run/ncbi.py`
  (esearch/esummary/taxonomy efetch, 3 req/s, injectable transport) · `plastid panel refresh |
  propose | pin`. Closed P1-12 as a **dev decision** (local for phases 1–5/8, remote for 6–7) and
  added the "Who decides what" rule to CLAUDE.md so engineering calls stop being queued for the PI.
- **Validation:** `make check` (94 fast + 13 golden). Live NCBI run: 76 RefSeq genomes for
  Iridaceae; a re-pinned NC_050833.1 whose **sha256 matches the vendored golden file byte-for-byte**
  (`a946f23e…`), NC_024936.1 → `fd441727…`. Measured and recorded in PROJECT.md §9.C-20: NCBI's
  `chloroplast[filter]` misses "plastid"-worded records (71 vs 76) — including our own comparison
  genome.
- **Residual risks:** the panel's tier model relies on NCBI lineage strings (genus = last component);
  a record with an unusual lineage would land in the wrong tier — the user confirms the final list,
  and `propose` prints the tier for every candidate. `pin()` records unparseable downloads as
  `parse_error` rather than failing the batch — a caller must check it (the CLI prints UNVERIFIED).
- **Blocked:** nothing. Waiting on people only: real reads + nuclear genome (Phase 6/7), item (c).
- **Next:** Phase 2, starting with M2.1 (gene content & summary statistics).

### 2026-10-02 · Claude · dev WSL

- **Did:** created the session set (CLAUDE.md · ROADMAP.md · TASKS.md · HANDOFF.md); squashed git
  history into one `init` commit and force-pushed (amended to remove Claude attribution — repo rule
  + memory); built **P1-01** scaffold, **P1-02** core model + BioPython GenBank reader + vendored
  golden data (sha256-pinned), **P1-03** IR detection + mandatory gate + coordinate normalization.
  §10.6 decided and recorded (GenBank coords per genome · normalized for cross-genome figures).
- **Validation:** `make check` (40 fast + 7 golden, no skips); the 20-genome sweep reproduces
  PROJECT.md §8.3 — 7/9 vs GenBank, gate catches 2/2 diverged genomes with 0 false alarms; golden
  tier-A numbers asserted in tests. Recorded in PROJECT.md §8.5.
- **Did (cont.):** §10.7 decided (reports resolve table cells; an unresolvable reference raises) →
  PROJECT.md §3/§10. **P1-04 green** — `result/result.py` (`Scope` · `Column` · `Table` · `Result`,
  refs `table.column` / `table[row].column`) and `result/export.py` (csv with provenance comments,
  json with raw values, markdown); exports byte-identical across runs.
- **Residual risks:** de-novo detection is still silently short on 1/9 known cases (NC_063920 →
  22,998 bp vs the true 26,161); the annotation cross-check *records* the 3,163 bp disagreement but
  the run does not fail on it — decide the policy later. The de-novo detector is unvalidated on
  mitochondria. `csv` exports carry provenance as `#` comments — readers must strip them (stdlib
  `csv` cannot).
- **Blocked:** §10.8/§10.9 (P1-10) · D-01. Nothing blocks P1-05.
- **Next:** P1-05 test-first — run layout, manifest, `run_tool()` (the single subprocess door), cache.
